## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Choose your platform**: Navigate to the appropriate directory (`aws/`, `gcp/`, or `vmware/`)
2. **Configure your variables**: Edit `terraform.tfvars` with your environment-specific values
3. **Deploy**: Run `terraform init`, `terraform plan`, and `terraform apply`


## 📁 Repository Structure

AWS_5.1/ # AWS CloudFormation-based deployment
GCP_5.1/ # Google Cloud Platform deployment
Deployment/Vmware vSphere/ # VMware vSphere deployment


**Quick Deploy:**
```bash
cd aws/
# Edit terraform.tfvars with your AWS-specific values
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

# 🔐 Security Considerations

* AWS: Configure security groups and IAM roles appropriately
* GCP: Set up firewall rules and service accounts
* VMware: Ensure proper network segmentation and access controls
* All Platforms: Use strong passwords and enable encryption where available
# 📋 Prerequisites by Platform

# AWS

* Valid AWS account with appropriate permissions
* VPC with public/private subnets
* Internet Gateway and NAT Gateway (if using private subnets)
* EC2 Key Pair for SSH access

# GCP

## Google Cloud Project with billing enabled
* Compute Engine API enabled
* VPC networks and subnets configured
* Service account with appropriate permissions

# VMware vSphere

## vCenter Server 6.7 or later
* ESXi hosts with sufficient resources
* Distributed switches or standard switches configured
* Hammerspace OVA file (contact Hammerspace for access)

# 🚨 Important Notes

## Network Configuration: VMware deployments require network names to be specified in tfvars files (no hardcoded defaults)
* Resource Requirements: Ensure sufficient compute, memory, and storage resources before deployment
* Licensing: Hammerspace licensing may be required depending on deployment size
* Backup: Always backup your Terraform state files
* Testing: Test deployments in non-production environments first
